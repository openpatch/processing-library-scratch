# Scratch for Java

To ease the transition from the block-based programming environment
[Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) to Java this
library was created. Therefore, the core elements of Scratch are remodeled.

The following video show a Scratch project and a similar BlueJ project using the Scratch for Java library.

::youtube[Comparision Scratch and Scratch for Java]{#3wKw2WWQcXk}

If you want to compare it yourself, you can take a look inside both projects:

- Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/338613208
- BlueJ: [Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/openpatch/scratch-for-java/blob/main/examples/archives/Halloween/) or [Project Halloween.zip](/archives/Halloween.zip)
